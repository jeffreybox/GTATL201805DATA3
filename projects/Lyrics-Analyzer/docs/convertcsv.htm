Deteriorata.  Go placidly amid the noise and waste, And remember what comfort there may be in owning a piece thereof. Avoid quiet and passive persons, unless you are in need of sleep. Rotate your tires. Speak glowingly of those greater than yourself, And heed well their advice, even though they be turkeys. Know what to kiss, and when. Consider that two wrongs never make a right, but that three do. Wherever possible, put people on hold. Be comforted that in the face of all aridity and disillusionment, and despite the changing fortunes of time, There is always a big future in computer maintenance.  You are a fluke of the universe.

<td>G-G-Giving you, giving you. G-G-Giving you, giving you. G-G-Giving you, giving you. Here we go. 1, 2, 3, 4. Lately, I&#39;ve been trying to figure out your mind and why you keep dissin&#39; me, Poor little me. And why you have a change of heart to turn it all around And then try to put it on me, Poor little me. But don&#39;t you know I can be a trip. I can make things hard. But baby, I believe that you still got a heart. That&#39;s why I try to stop myself before I start, &#39;Cause I can make it tough. I can make it rough, but I won&#39;t. Well, I&#39;ll be giving you the benefit of the doubt. I&#39;m giving you a minute to try to work it on out. I&#39;ll be giving you the benefit of the doubt And I&#39;m giving you a minute to try to work it on out. Baby, work it on, work it on out. (Work, work, work.) Baby, work it on, work it on out. (Work, work, work.) Oooh, oooooooooh. Baby, how could you be hanging out on the town And claim that you&#39;re missing me, Poor little me, When you knew all the time that you could&#39;ve been with your homegirl lovin&#39; and a kissin&#39; on me, Sweet little me. But don&#39;t you know if you wanna be a man, You gotta work real hard. If you wanna make me feel like I&#39;m your number one, Then nothing in the world should make us part. &#39;Cause we can make it work, if you take away the hurt from my heart. I&#39;ll be giving you the benefit of the doubt And I&#39;m giving you a minute to try to work it on out. I&#39;ll be giving you the benefit of the doubt And I&#39;m giving you a minute to try to work it on out. Baby, work it on, work it on out. ...  </td>

Hittin&#39; up the Graveyard Shift with Real, Little Will, Big Wally, and Wish Bone. Little Wally highrollers, and he wonder why niggas so strong. Krayzie Bone, stack, Rod J--much love, kept a nigga on his toes in the game. It&#39;s an everyday thang, when you let your nuts hang, gotta make a grand at least daily, man. Them Cleveland hustlas, never no bustas. Thug to the heartbeat of niggas from the Land fool, and the old school. Just serve out your sentence and be cool. Fuckin&#39; with trues. Rest In Peace, little nigga Ripsta, stressed that Bone love. Smokin&#39; on bud, &#39;cause a nigga Mo Thug callin&#39; all my niggas when it&#39;s time to nut &#39;em. In the 9-9, haters gonna drop to the #1 with the gun, so run run. Cleveland is the city where a nigga come from, slangin&#39; them dum-dums. Krayzie Niggas it&#39;s goin&#39; down, up in the C-Town. Get &#39;em up with the thug (thug) and that nigga with the bud (bud). Get the fifth of Rose, but the liquor store closed and I&#39;m all out the forty. Raise up, nigga. Burn up the buddah, smoke it all up. Nigga, don&#39;t stiff on the reefer. Mo! runnin&#39; up outta the cut with this fresh sack of hydro, and this shit is creeper. Peep the street, bust again on Double Glock-glock with-ah-me rocks. Cops sweatin&#39; me block. Copper better drop when the gunshot pop, blood, dumpin&#39; the body and the bullshit stop. Whenever the trouble knocks with the po-po, niggas roll solo, split up, and swerve. Krayzie take caution. ...  </td>

<td>This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world! And while she looked so sad in photographs I absolutely love her When she smiles...  How many days in a year? She woke up with hope but she only found tears. And i can be so insincere Making her promises never for real! As long as she stands there waiting Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes! How many days disappear? When you look in the mirror so how do you choose? Your clothes never wear as well the next day And your hair never falls in quite the same way But you never seem to run out of things to say  This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world! ...  </td>
