Analyzes news on social media using VaderSentiment

Statement: Twitter has become a wildly sprawling jungle of informationâ€”140 characters at a time. Somewhere between 350 million and 500 million tweets are estimated to be sent out per day.  With such an explosion of data, on Twitter and elsewhere, it becomes more important than ever to tame it in some way, to concisely capture the essence of the data.

Objective of this code: create a Python script to perform a sentiment analysis of the Twitter activity of various news outlets, and to present your findings visually.

Output: Pulls last 100 tweets from:BBC, CBS, CNN, Fox, and New York times. Performs sentiment analysis using VaderSentiment with the compound, positive, neutral, and negative scoring for each tweet. Exports the data and images.
