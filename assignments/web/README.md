# web_scraping

This Python code creates a method that runs 5 unique web scrapes to gain urls and information that will be passed into a Flask webapp. As a sample, it uses multiple websites about the planet Mars to obtain this information. Links to sites are contained in index.html.

Applications: This Flask app uses Python, Beautiful Soup, Splinter's chromedriver, and MongoDB to scrape various sites and return real-time data on Mars (sources cited in the footer). Scraping takes about sixty seconds. Run mongod in shell before launching flask.
