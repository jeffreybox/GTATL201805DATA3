### Activities Preview

* **New Jersey Weather**

* Instructions

  * Using the following data, plot the monthly averages for temperature in New Jersey.

    * Use the numeric value for months.

    * Average temperature per month in Fahrenheit: `[39, 42, 51, 62, 72, 82, 86, 84, 77, 65, 55, 44]`

  * Use list comprehension to convert the temperature to celsius and plot that line as well.

  * Create a third plot that includes both lines.

* **Legendary Temperature**

* Instructions

  * Modify the New Jersey temperature line charts from earlier so that they match the image provided.

  * Once the plot has been created, look through the [MatPlotLib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/index.html) to see what additional formatting could be added to the chart.

* **Coaster Speed**

* Instructions

  * Create a line chart with two plots using the following data...

  * `Danger Drop: [9, 8, 90, 85, 80, 70, 70, 65, 55, 60, 70, 65, 50]`

  * `RailGun: [75, 70, 60, 65, 60, 45, 55, 50, 40, 40, 35, 35, 30]`

  * Both coasters are 120 seconds long and the speed was measured every 10 seconds.

  * Apply styling and labels that match the image provided.

* **Bars Bar Chart**

* Instructions

  * Using the file provided as a starter, create a bar chart that matches the image provided.

* **Pies Pie Chart**

* Instructions

  * Using the file provided as a starter, create a pie chart that matches the image provided.

* **Scatter Py**

* Instructions

  * Using the file provided as a starter, create a scatter plot that matches the image provided.

  * Create a new list called "scoop_price", fill it with values, and then set it so that the size of the dots are set according to those values.

* **Average Rainfall**

* Instructions

  * Using the resources provided, create a bar graph that matches that of the image provided.
