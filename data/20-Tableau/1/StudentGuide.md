### Activities Preview

* **Tableau Installation**

* Instructions:

  * Open up the web browser and navigate to the [Tableau Site](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/), we will now be installing the free version of the application, that includes the majority of features included within [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop).

    * ![Tableau Download](Images/02-Installation_PublicDownload.png)

    * The main difference between the two versions is in working with multiple types of data sources (SQL databases, for example), and in working with data files that are not shared with the public.

    * You can also download and explore the 14-day trial version of the paid software, but that all assignments in this unit can be completed with the free version.

    * Downloading and installing the application is very simple. Enter your email address into the box near the top of the webpage and then click on the "Download the App" button.

    * Once the application has been downloaded, simply click on the executable and install the software.

* **Explore Data**

* Instructions:

  * [Readme.pdf](Activities/03-Stu_Exploration/Unsolved/Readme.pdf)

* **No Shows**

* Instructions:

  * Create a line chart that compares the ages of patients against the total number of appointments. Then split this graph based upon gender and whether the patient showed up to their appointment. For this first step, you'll need to convert `Age` from a measure to a dimension.

  * Create a pair of bar charts that compare how many patients showed up to appointments versus how many were no-shows in different neighborhoods.

  * Create a stacked bar chart that compares no-shows to those who made it to appointment based upon the day of the week.

  * Create a pair of line graphs that compare age versus diabetes in both men and women.

  * Create a pair of line graphs that compare age versus alcoholism in both men and women.

* **FIFA Analysis**

* Instructions:

  * Create a join between each of the charts so that each player's data is matched up correctly.

  * Create a pair of charts that compare the potential of a club's players to their overall ability (`Overall` column). Then sort them from best to worst.

  * Create a chart that determines which soccer club is the most aggressive overall.

  * Create a chart that determines which nationality has the greatest acceleration on average, making sure to note how many players are from each nation in a second chart.

  * Create a chart that determines which nationality has the greatest long passing on average.

  * Create a chart that marks the potential of a player over time as they age.

* **The Ultimate Candy**

* Instructions:

  * Create a pair of bar graphs that chart the win percent of each candy, then color the bars according to whether they are fruity and/or chocolatey.

  * Create a scatter plot comparing the sugar percentage against the win percentage. Color the points based upon whether they are chocolatey and size them according to price.

  * Create one more scatter plot comparing the sugar percentage against the win percentage. Color the points based upon whether they are fruity and size them according to price.

* **Degrees That Pay**

* Instructions:

  * Create a story using the datasets provided and formulate graphs that might be used to explore the following hypotheses:

  * "Ivy League schools offer best salaries while state offer worst"

  * "Going to school in California/NE offers higher salaries"

  * "Higher starting salaries generally mean higher salaries mid-career"

  * Bonus: Create a chart that visualizes starting median salaries, by major, against mid-career median, 75th percentile, and 90th percentile salaries.
