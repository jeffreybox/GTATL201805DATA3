### Activities Preview

* **CNN Soup**

* Instructions

  * Believe it or not, CNN's website for [1996: Year in Review](http://edition.cnn.com/EVENTS/1996/year.in.review/) is still alive on the web! We have, however, stored the HTML document as a string in your starter file.

  * Your task, should you accept it (and you should), is to use Beautiful Soup to scrape and print the following pieces of information:

  1. The title of the webpage

  2. All paragraph texts on the page

  3. The top 10 headlines for the year. This last one is a bit tricky and may not come out perfectly!

* **Reddit Scraper**

* Instructions**:

  * In this activity, you will scrape the [Python Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/) using Beautiful Soup. Scrape only threads that have twenty or more comments and then print the thread's title, number of comments, as well as the URL for the thread.

* **Hockey Headers**

* Instructions

  * Teamwork! Speed! Mental and physical toughness! Passion! Excitement! Unpredictable matchups down to the wire! What could be better? While these terms could easily be applied to a data science hackathon, we're talking about the magnificent sport of hockey.

  * Your assignment is to scrape the articles on the front page of the [NHL website](https://www.nhl.com/) - which is frequently updated - and then post the results of your scraping to MongoDB.

  * Use Beautiful Soup and requests to scrape the title and heading of each article on the front page.

  * Post the above information as a MongoDB document and then print all of the documents on the database to the console.

  * In addition to the above, post the time and date of the article publication as well.

* **Bookscraper**

* In this activity, we will practice the webscraping skills on a site.

* **Doctor Decoder**

* Instructions

  * [README](Activities/10-Stu_Doctor_Decoder/README.md)
  
  * You may need to install `html5lib` with the console command, `pip install html5lib`.
