### Activities Preview

* **From Python to JavaScript**

* Instructions

  *  For this activity, the class will work their way through some of the introductory Python scripts and translate them into JavaScript code.

  * When coding these activities, open up the original Python script next to the JavaScript code. This way you can easily compare and contrast the two languages.

* **JavaScript Loan Approver**

* Instructions
  
    * Work in pairs to complete the following assignment.

* **JavaScript Arrays**

* Instructions

  * This activity will introduce to arrays in JavaScript.

  * Open the unsolved blank JavaScript file, `arrays.js`, and code the solution. Be sure to show the output of each code snippet in the Chrome Inspector console.

* **Movie Scores**

* Instructions
  
  * Students will use conditionals and loops to iterate through an array of movie scores and sort scores into new arrays by their values.

* **Statistics Functions**

* Instructions

  * Using the movie array from earlier as a starting point, create functions that will return statistical values from any given array of data.

  * Create functions that will find the following:

    * Mean
    * Variance
    * Standard Deviation

  * Each function should `console.log` both the name of the statistic used and its value. For example "The Mean is: 33.3".

  * The functions should be able to take any array of numbers and return the statistical value.

  * After you have the functions working with movie data set run them on the following additional data points:

    * `monthlyAvgRainFall = [3.03, 2.48, 3.23, 3.15, 4.13, 3.23]`
    * `mileRunTimes = [5.06, 4.54, 5.56, 4.40, 7.10]`
