## Unit 17.3 – More Leaflet

### Overview

In this class, students will further develop their Leaflet skills by working on a mini-project in which they will map Citi Bike data. During the second half of the class, we will give students some review time and go over any exercises they thought were difficult. The remainder of the class will be used to assign students to project groups and draft project 2 proposals.
