* **A Map of Your Very Own**

  * Get into small groups. You will create a map of your very own from scratch. You will find a dataset, map it, then use a new plugin to visualize the data in an interesting way.

  * You will share their map with the class and give a VERY brief presentation on it at the end of the day.

    * The focus of this assignment is on getting a working map, however, so the presentations are wholly secondary to making something cool.

  * Mini-Presentations on Maps
