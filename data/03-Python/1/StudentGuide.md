# Unit 3.1 - Let's Begin Python

## Overview

In today's class, students will transition from VBA to the programming language Python. Today's class will check Python installation for students, then cover the basics of terminal navigation, variables, conditionals and loops.

### Class Objectives

* Students will install Python 3.
* Students will be able to navigate their desktop via the terminal.
* Students will be able to create Python scripts and run them in terminal.
* Students will be able to understand basic programming concepts in Python.

### Activities Preview

* **Terminal**
* Instructions

  * Follow along with these instructions in your terminal and write the commands below.

  * Create a folder called `LearnPython`.

  * Navigate into the folder

  * Inside `LearnPython` create another folder called `Assignment1`

  * Inside `Assignment1` create a file called `quick_python.py`

  * Add a print statement to `quick_python.py`

  * Run `quick_python.py`

  * Return to the `LearnPython` folder

  * Inside `LearnPython` create another folder called `Assignment2`

  * Inside `Assignment2` create a file called `quick_python2.py`

  * Add a different print statement to `quick_python2.py`

  * Run `quick_python2.py`

* **Check Anaconda installation**

* **Create A Virtual Environment**

* **Hello Variable World!**
* Instructions

  * Create two variables called `name` and `country` that will hold strings.

  * Create two variables called `age` and `hourly_wage` that will hold integers.

  * Create a variable called `satisfied` which will hold a boolean.

  * Create a variable called `daily_wage` that will hold the value of `hourly_wage` multiplied by 8.

  * Print out statements using all of the above variables to the console.

* **Down To Input**
* Instructions

  * Create two different variables that will take the input of your first name and your neighbors first name.

  * Create two more inputs that will ask how many months each of you have been coding.

  * Finally, display a result with both your names and the total amount of months coding.

* **Conditional Conundrum**
* Instructions

  * Look through the conditionals within the provided code and figure out which lines will be printed to the console.

  * Do not run the application at first, see if you can follow the thought process for each chunk of code and then place a guess. Only after coming up with a guess for each section should you run the application.

* **Rock, Paper, Scissors**
* Instructions

  * Using the terminal, take an input of `r`, `p` or `s` which will stand for rock, paper, and scissors.

  * Have the computer randomly pick one of these three choices.

  * Compare the user's input to the computer's choice in order to determine if the user won, lost, or tied.

* **Number Chain**
* Instructions

  * Using a `while` loop, ask the user "How many numbers?", and then print out a chain of ascending numbers from 0 to the number input.

  * After the results have printed, ask the user if they would like to continue. If "y" is entered, keep the chain running by inputting a new number and starting a new count from 0 to the number input. If "n" is entered, exit the application.
