# Unit 3.2 - Reading, Writing, and Pyrithmetic

### Overview

During today's class, the class will be diving further into reading and writing data from/to external CSV files. They will also dive into Python dictionaries, zipping lists, and functions.

### Class Objectives

* Students should feel confident reading data into Python from CSV files

* Students should feel confident writing data from Python into CSV files

* Students should know how to zip two lists together and when this is helpful

* Students should have a firm understanding on how to create and use Python functions

### Activities Preview

* **Python Check-Up**
* Instructions

  * Create a simple Python command line application. Upon running, the application should:

    * Print "Hello User!"

    * Then ask: "What is your name? "

    * Then respond: "Hello &lt;user's name>"

    * Then ask: "What is your age? "

    * Then respond: "Awww... you're just a baby!" or "Ah... A well traveled soul are ye." depending on the user's age.

* **Kid in a Candy Store**
* Instructions

  * Create a loop that prints all of the candies in the store to the terminal with their index stored in brackets beside them.

    * For example: `"[0] Snickers"`

  * Create a loop that runs for a number of times as determined by the variable `allowance`.

    * For example: If allowance is equal to five, the loop should run five times.

  * Each time this second loop runs, take in a user's input - preferably a number - and then add the candy with a matching index to the variable `candyCart`.

    * For example: If the user enters "0" as their input, "Snickers" should be added into the `candyCart` list.

  * Use another loop to print all of the candies selected to the terminal.

* **House of Pies**
* Instructions

  * **Part 1**

    * Create an order form that will display a list of pies to the user in the following way:

    ```
    Welcome to the House of Pies! Here are our pies:

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    (1) Pecan, (2) Apple Crisp, (3) Bean, (4) Banoffee,  (5) Black Bun, (6) Blueberry, (7) Buko, (8) Burek,  (9) Tamale, (10) Steak
    ```

    * Then prompt the user to select which pie they'd like to order via number.

    * Immediately after, follow the order with `Great! We'll have that <PIE NAME> right out for you` and then ask if they would like to make another order. If so, repeat the process.

    * Once the user is done purchasing pies, print the total number of pies ordered.

  * **Part 2 (Very Challenging!)**

    * Modify the application once again, this time conclude the user's purchases by listing out the total pie count broken by _each_ pie.

    ```
    You purchased:
    0 Pecan
    0 Apple Crisp
    0 Bean
    2 Banoffee
    0 Black Bun
    0 Blueberry
    0 Buko
    0 Burek
    0 Tamale
    1 Steak
    ```

* **Module Playground**
* Instructions
  * There are tons of built-in modules for Python and there is no possible way that a single class could cover all of them. For the time being, however, provide students with the opportunity to look through some of Python's modules and play around with them.

* **Reading NetFlix**
* Instructions

  * Prompt the user for what video they are looking for.

  * Search through the `netflix_ratings.csv` to find the user's video.

  * If the CSV contains the user's video then print out the title, what it is rated and the current user ratings.

    * For example: `'Grease is rated PG with a rating of 86'`

* **Udemy Zip**
* Instructions

  * Create a Python application that reads the data on Udemy Web Development offerings.

  * Then store the contents of the Title, Price, Subscriber Count, Number of Reviews, and Course Length into Python Lists.

  * Then zip these lists together into a single tuple.

  * Finally, write the contents of your extracted data into a CSV. Make sure to include the titles of these columns in your csv.
